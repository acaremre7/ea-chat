# ea-chat

PHP web application made for Bunq


Test Description:

Write a very simple ‘chat’ application backend in PHP. A user should be able to send a simple text
message to another user and a user should be able to get the messages sent to him and the
author users of those messages. The users and messages should be stored in a simple SQLite
database. All communication between the client and server should happen over a simple JSON
based protocol over HTTP (which may be periodically refreshed to poll for new messages). A GUI,
user registration and user login are not needed but the users should be identified by some token
or ID in the HTTP messages and the database. You have the freedom to use any framework and
libraries; keep in mind that we love custom-build.
